# Desired features

* Possible to add, delete and mark tasks as done.
* Possible to show tasks in Google Calendar.
* Possible to set advanced rules for recurring tasks (such as "10 days after last completion" or "every Wednesday"). This could be done programmatically -- no need for advanced graphical configuration. Possible to "check and reschedule" recurring tasks, in contrast to "check and disable".
* Possible to set points awarded for completing tasks.
* Possible to set (advanced) rules for how points change when deadline for a task has passed.
* Possible to show tasks in priority order (as described by points).
* Reasonable default behaviour for task points.
